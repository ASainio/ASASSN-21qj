ABSTRACT:


We report follow up research on long period dimming event on solar type star ASAS-SN 21qj (J0815-3859) located near Puppis constellation at ~567pc from our solar system. 
The source had a stable optical flux untill 2021-08-26 when All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN, Shappee et al. 2014, Kochanek et al. 2017)  reported beginning of long period dimming event (Quote atel). Event has lasted to end of 2021 and has included series of ??? events.

During follow up research we discovered significant reddening beginning prior the optical dimming period. 
The source had a stable mid-infrared flux on Wide-field Infrared Survey(WISE) untill 7/2017 and when WISE observed the target region 
again at 4/2018 the source had reddened in W1 about 0.3 magnitudes and in W2 about 0.8 magnitudes. W1-W2 increased from ~-0.1 to 0.35 suggesting notable developement 
of infrared excess. (We did not find any changes in optical flux during this time period suggesting the event causing reddening did not happen between observer and the source.)



INFRARED:
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission was launched in December 2009. WISE surveyed the full sky in four infrared wavelength bands 3.4(W1), 4.6(W2), 12(W3) and 22 μm(W4). WISE was placed on hibernation February 2011 after its hydrogen cooling had depleted four months earlier.  (Quote neowise site @https://neowise.ipac.caltech.edu/)

In 2013 WISE satellite was re-activated and continued whole sky survey as NEOWISE mission using two infrared bands W1 and W2 covering the sky twice a year. ()

We retrieved all point source photometry from NEOWISE-R Single Exposure (L1b) Source Table for years from 2013 to 2020 and requested later NEOWISE-R data from NEOWISE crew for unreleased epochs from 4/2021 and 10/2021.  
We continued retrieving older WISE mission data and GLIMPSE360 mission data both from 2010. 

We concluded that all W1 and W2 infrared data from 2010 WISE data to epoch at 10/2017 from NEOWISE had stable and nominal 
infrared behaviour for stellar analog. (source for stellar analog?)  We did not detect any infrared excess, 
flaring or fluxtuations on GLIMPSE360 or WISE W1 and W2 bands until beginning of significant reddening between epochs 10/2017 and 4/2018, 

(suggesting that dust detected in W1 and w2 is due to recent event at stellar orbit rather than variability component.)

Earlier multiple groups have been using succesfully W1-W4 wavelengths combined with optical inspections to discover thousands of stellar disc candidates and hundreds of confirmed stellar disks or Young Solar Objects (YSO). Commong factor for these objects have been strong detection in W4. Kuchner at al. list that in previous studies objects with low W4 SNR (<3) have had high false positive rate. We carefully inspected J0815-3859 W3 and W4 detections from 2010 and concluded W4 being non-detection and and W3 having poor snr ~2.6. We further concluded that this data was not usable to make conclusions about existence of pre-event dust. A null-detection excess in W3 and W4 does not necessarily indicate the total absence of pre-event dust around a star because of instrument limitations. 

...I need to add J and J-H....

2MASSSSSSS!! Does UKIRT have anything this south??? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

"In general, an IR excess suggests the existence of warm dust around a star. "

"IR excess in main-sequence Sun-like stars is believed to
result from the production of collisional dust during the final
stages of planet formation, at least for relatively young stars, or
produced around older stars as long as dust is liberated in
higher-speed collisions (Wyatt 2008; Krivov 2010)."

So the IR brightening started between 58071 - 58225. Sector 7 starts from 58400, so no tess data from IR event start. :(

 


The possible collasion event did not happen between us and the star. That is why the star 
did not immediatly dim. The IR excess did rise because collasion happened "next" to star creating heat and dust visible only in infrared. 
The IR excess from event was so strong on stars orbit that center point of WISE data shifted slightly towards the dust cloud. 
We can use that to determine direction of the eclipse and it helps with simulating later events?
Optical dimmening begun later when the dust cloud moved to between us and the host star.

Random:

IF brightening started between epochs of 10/2017 4/2018/.

I measured ~150mas difference between pre event WISE data center-point vs. data
during the event. Later in WISE data, center point seems to be moving back towards what it was pre-event.

w4= 9.028  SNR?	22.1 -2.6 (not detectable in w4?) 
Object not detected in WISE W4 but lets check Glimpse360 that should be more sensitive.
Glimbse360 has only 4.5 and 3.6 that are identical with older wise w1, w2.
