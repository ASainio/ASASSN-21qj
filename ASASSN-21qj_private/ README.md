I am retrieving all available time series. I ins0ect each dataset for transit components. I remove outliers manually and using lightkurve. I run both manually enhanced and lightkurve enhancaed datasets thru Box_least_squares algorithm for finding periods. I compare suggested periods between  data products. I merge light curves from diferent sources to create longer period data set, I flatten the data and run whole dataset thru BLS.

I have previously retrieve pretty much all available single detections -those can be found in History folder.


Workflow:
        
VISTA VVV(X)        In Area       Done                    after 58200         Manually subtracked magnitudes from raw fits files and created Ks lghtcurve.
ASAS                In Area       IN Progress             prior 58200         Huge center off set
ASAS-SN             In Area       Done                    Prioar and after    V-mag is before 8200 but is messy. I have processed this data with BLS and LK.
TESS                In Area       Done                    after 58200         TIC 182582608
AAVSO/APASS         In Area       Done                    after 58200         Has B,V, I after the event. 
GAIA light curve    In Area                               Prior               Not directly available, but can we get it?
